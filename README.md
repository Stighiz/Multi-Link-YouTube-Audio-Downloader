# Multi-Link-YouTube-Audio-Downloader

This Python script uses the `yt_dlp` library to download multiple YouTube videos at once and automatically convert them to high-quality `.wav` or `.mp3` audio files. 

All video URLs should be added to the `urls` list, separated by commas. The downloaded audio files will be saved to the folder specified in the `output_path` variable.
